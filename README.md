Script for getting basic Google Scholar citation information

Use for your own caution, because Google doesn't allow one to crawl the Scholar data base. So there is chance that your IP might be blocked by Google for a short amount of time.


Usage: Require Python 2.7.4+
./gs.py scholar_id  // this will grab all citations' bittex and store in the local directory for each of you paper

or
./gs.py  // this will tell you how many self-citations and how many independent citations if you already have those bib files in the directory
